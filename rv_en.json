The caldron is made hot; I will proclaim it.\n27 She, lady of all treasure, is come hither yearning in spirit for her calf and lowing.\nMay this cow yield her milk for both the Aśvins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.\n28 The cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling; she licks his forehead, as she lows, to form it.\nHis mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him with milk while gently lowing.\n29 He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow laws as she clings unto the shedder of the rain.\nShe with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal man, and, turned to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.\n30 That which hath breath and speed and life and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses.\nLiving, by offerings to the Dead he moveth Immortal One, the brother of the mortal.\n31 I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by his pathways and departing.\nHe, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels.\n32 He who hath made him cloth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely is he hidden.\nHe, yet enveloped in his Mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.\n33 Dyaus is my Father, my begetter: kinship is here.

These were the customs in the days aforetime,\n44 Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended.\nOne with his powers the universe regardeth: Of one, the sweep is seen, but his figure.\n45 Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who have understanding know them.\nThree kept in close concealment cause no motion; of speech, men speak only the fourth division.\n46 They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutmān.\nTo what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan.\n47 Dark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured; up to the heaven they fly robed in the waters.\nAgain descend they from the seat of Order, and all the earth is moistened with their fatness.\n48 Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the naves.
